                <h1>Team, Work & Philosophy</h1>
                <p>
                    As a full fledged digital creative professional agency, we pride on minimalistic approach yet employ
                    most advanced technology. In the era of mass media, we continue to make the most impact through
                    specialized research, creative design and sustainable implementation of digital technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, we evaluate the client requirements to ensure we can fullfill all the needs. Then, we review
                    the business model or professional approach with respect to the industry standards. And
                    then, we formulate a quote to specific request while offering our business insights. Onwards, we
                    apply our pioneer methodology in all of our creative work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of our creative work ranging from design, photography to coding websites are part of our
                    original work. For portfolio websites, We do not use templates, plugins or any form of prebuilt
                    themes. The same goes for our design and photography, we create our own artwork and
                    professional images from the ground. We treat our client projects as our own; hence, we let clients
                    see our creative work in each step of the way to final product.

                </p>
                <p>

                    There are several reasons as to why
                    we have such a business philosophy. One, every business deserves a unique identity that is why
                    google
                    penalize duplicate contents online. Second, we protect our clients as well as our business because
                    free sources often come with some sort of strings attached such as limitations, restrictions even
                    litigations. Third,
                    customers do take
                    notice when a business model is original; which, in return bring long term trust and thriving
                    business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the criticism to our business model is that we are trying to reinvent the wheel. We agree but
                    we are yet to find a perfect wheel that fits our client business models. In real world, no one
                    drives a
                    tractor trailer to deliver pizza; that would be hectic. However, in the digital world, businesses
                    continue to do that; only experts see that.
