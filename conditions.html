                <h1>Digital Designers: Contract Agreement</h1>
                <p>The following contract is a legal service agreement between company “Digital Designers” and the
                    “Client”. All aspects of the service are bound by the professional service standards within the
                    province of Ontario. For clarity, Digital Designers is the sole service provider and the client is
                    the recipient of the service. In order to fully address the specific legal requirements, contract
                    agreement is divided into the following subsections.</p>

                    overdue balances for reissuing each invoice at 45, 60, 75 and 90 days from the date of original
                    invoice. The grant of any license or right of copyright is conditioned on receipt of full payment.
                </p>
                <h3>2. Default in payment</h3>
                <p>The Client shall assume responsibility for cost outlays by designer in all collections of unpaid fees
                    and of legal fees necessitated by default in payment. Invoices in default will include but are not
                    limited to fees for collection and legal costs.</p>
                <h3>3. Estimates</h3>
                <p>The fees and expenses shown are minimum estimates only unless an hourly fee has been agreed upon.
                    That fee will be $50.00 per hour and the designer shall keep the client apprised of a tally of hours
                    within a reasonable period of time. Final fees and expenses shall be shown when invoice is rendered.
                    The fees and expenses shown are minimum estimates only unless the quote and/or invoice is clearly
                    marked Firm Quote, otherwise the below stated hourly fee will be payable on all time over that which
                    was quoted with a minimum in 30 minutes increments.</p>

                    requested by the customer, will alter the time and cost. The Client shall offer the Designer the
                    first opportunity to make any changes.</p>
