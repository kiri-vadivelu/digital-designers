                <h1>Service Agreement</h1>
                <h3>Acknowledgement</h3>
                <p>This agreement contains the entire understanding between the Digital Designers and the Client. It
                    supersedes all prior and simultaneous agreements between the Parties. Agreement must be signed in
                    prior to commencing the service. By signing the document, the service provider and recipient
                    acknowledge entirety of terms and conditions for the service. The only way to add or change this
                    agreement is to do so in writing, signed by all the Parties. If the Parties want to waive one
                    provision of this agreement, that does not mean that any other provision is also waived. The party
                    against whom a waiver is sought to be effective must have signed a waiver in writing.</p>
                <h3>WHAT DO BOTH PARTIES AGREE TO DO?</h3>
                <p>As our client, you have the power to enter into this contract on behalf of your company or
                    organization. You agree to provide us with everything necessary to complete the project including
                    logo, text, images, link(s) to social media, hosting credentials and any other information we
                    request as we need it, and in the format we require. We wish to avoid any delays. Deadlines work
                    both ways and you as well will be bound by any dates/timelines that we set forth. You also agree to
                    adhere to the payment schedule outlined in this agreement.</p>
                <p>We have the experience and ability to perform the requested services and will carry out our work in a
                    professional and timely manner. We cannot be held responsible for a missed website launch date or
                    deadline if you have not provided all content and/or revisions on time.</p>
                <h3>TIMELINE </h3>
                <p>Our estimated time required to complete your website is 30-60 days. We will commence the work after
                    we have received a signed contract and the non-refundable initial deposit of 50 percent. Please also
                    keep in mind that we rely on you and your team to provide us with the necessary assets (including
                    but not limited to website text, photos, social media, products, pricing, etc.), and approvals in
                    order for us to work on your website, and to avoid impacting your website launch date.</p>
                <h3>ERROR REVIEW </h3>
                <p>We provide you with a 7 day window from the date of website migration to your hosting for error
                    review. This does not include new website revisions, but errors that may have occurred during
                    migration. It is your responsibility as the client to review your website during this time and point
                    out any errors to be corrected. Any error that you find after the 7 days, will be charged our hourly
                    rate of $50.00.</p>
                <h3>MIGRATION OF WEBSITE </h3>
                <p>Once the project deliverables have been approved, we require full payment of your projectâ€™s remaining
                    balance before migrating your website onto your hosting. From the time the website is completed and
                    ready for launch, you have a maximum of 30 days to provide us with your hosting and domain
                    information. If that information is not provided, there is a possibility that the website will be
                    removed from our server without notice. Extensions can be provided upon written request.</p>
                <h3>RECOMMENDED HOSTING </h3>
                <p>We recommend the following hosts (specific packages are outlined), to ensure that you have a smooth
                    migration experience and ensure no additional billable time. As the client, you are responsible for
                    the management and maintenance of your hosting and domain at all times. All hosting/domain packages
                    must be paid annually to the hosting company of your choosing. The recommended hosting services are
                    Digital Ocean, Amazon Web, Blue Host and Go Daddy. Digital Designers have no affiliation with any of
                    the hosting service providers. </p>
                <h3>BROWSER FUNCTIONALITY </h3>
                <p>All of our websites are tested for functionality on current Safari, Chrome, Firefox internet
                    browsers. We do not guarantee that your website will look exactly the same on every screen, and may
                    appear differently due to varying screen resolutions and aspect ratios.</p>
                <h3>STATEMENT OF WORK </h3>
                <p>We have prepared the price quote (refer to page 1) based on everything that we have discussed,
                    including any correspondence via email, in-person, or phone calls. The breakdown is outlined in the
                    Statement of Work document which includes the scope of work, project objectives, tasks,
                    deliverables, certain terms, conditions and requirements as well as payment of the project. We are
                    only responsible for the items outlined in the Statement of Work. Items not included in the
                    Statement of Work are not part of the project nor have they been included in the quoted cost.</p>
                <h3>ADDITIONS </h3>
                <p>Please review the Statement of Work and if you have any additional feature requests, changes in
                    tasks, changes in deliverables or any scope modifications, beyond what was agreed and signed off on
                    in the original Statement of Work, additional billable time will be incurred to you as the client at
                    our hourly rate of $50.00.</p>
                <h3>REVISIONS</h3>
                <p>The price estimate includes time for revisions, and that will not exceed 10 percent of the total
                    budget of web development time mentioned on page 2. Should you request additional revisions beyond
                    what is included, or that exceed the allocated time, you will receive an email notification from us
                    requesting a confirmation that you wish to proceed with said revisions and agree that you will be
                    billed at our hourly rate of $50.00. After we have received your confirmation we will proceed.</p>
                <h3>ALLOWANCES </h3>
                <p>You are responsible for the cost of any outside paid assets. This is included but not limited to
                    hosting, domains, SSL certificates, third party plugins, stock images, and premium fonts. In
                    addition, we cannot be held liable for the functionality of third-party plugin or software,
                    recommended or otherwise.</p>
                <h3>EXCLUSIVE DESIGN CREDIT </h3>
                <p>Like a parking ticket, this agreement is non-transferable and non-refundable. The initial deposit
                    does not constitute a credit, and therefore cannot be used toward our other services. You are
                    accountable for the full balance of your contract whether you decide to complete website or not.</p>
                <h3>LIABILITY </h3>
                <p>Digital Designers will do everything possible to build you an amazing website, but we accept no
                    liability for your sales, revenue, and/or the success of your website/business directly, indirectly,
                    or consequentially. This contract is a legally binding document, and cannot be renewed. If for some
                    reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain
                    in place.</p>
                <h3>Payment</h3>
                <p>All invoices are payable within 30 days of receipt. A $25.00 service charge is payable on all
                    overdue balances for reissuing each invoice at 45, 60, 75 and 90 days from the date of original
                    invoice. The grant of any license or right of copyright is conditioned on receipt of full payment.
                </p>
                <h3>Default in payment</h3>
                <p>The Client shall assume responsibility for cost outlays by designer in all collections of unpaid fees
                    and of legal fees necessitated by default in payment. Invoices in default will include but are not
                    limited to fees for collection and legal costs.</p>
                <h3>Estimates</h3>

                    was quoted with a minimum in 30 minutes increments.</p>
                <h3>Changes</h3>
                <p>The Client must assume that all additions, alterations, changes in content, layout or process changes
                    requested by the customer, will alter the time and cost. The Client shall offer the Designer the
                    first opportunity to make any changes.</p>

                    project is on an hourly basis or a percentage based on the time estimate for the entire job. A 100%
                    cancellation fee is due once the project has been finished, whether delivered to the client or not.

                    whichever is greater.</p>
